  Many students struggle to find available study rooms and lose valuable time navigating outdated or manual booking systems. To fix this, one solution is to create aÂ **simple app or website**Â that helps students easily view which rooms are free, book a time slot, and get reminders. This system would cut down confusion, make shared spaces easier to access, and help students stay organized during busy study periods.
